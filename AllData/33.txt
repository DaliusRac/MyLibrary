What is HTML?
HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language
HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages
HTML describes the structure of a Web page
HTML consists of a series of elements
HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content
HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>My First Heading</h1>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

Example Explained
The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph


Links

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>HTML Links</h2>
<p>HTML links are defined with the a tag:</p>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>

</body>
</html>


Images

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>HTML Images</h2>
<p>HTML images are defined with the img tag:</p>

<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">

</body>
</html>


Line breaker 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body> 

<p>This is a <br> paragraph with a line break.</p>

</body>
</html>

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>The href Attribute</h2>

<p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

</body>
</html>


There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.


The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Colors 

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>The style Attribute</h2>
<p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color:</p>

<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>

<p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>

</body>
</html>

Chapter Summary
All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Bigger Headings
Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS font-size property:

<h1 style="font-size:60px;">Heading 1</h1>

Background Color
The CSS background-color property defines the background color for an HTML element.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body style="background-color:powderblue;">

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>

/////

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="background-color:powderblue;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="background-color:tomato;">This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


Fonts
The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used for an HTML element:

<h1 style="font-family:verdana;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This is a paragraph.</p>


Text Size
The CSS font-size property defines the text size for an HTML element:

<h1 style="font-size:300%;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="font-size:160%;">This is a paragraph.</p>

Text Alignment
The CSS text-align property defines the horizontal text alignment for an HTML element:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 style="text-align:center;">Centered Heading</h1>
<p style="text-align:center;">Centered paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


HTML Formatting Elements
Formatting elements were designed to display special types of text:

<b> - Bold text
<strong> - Important text
<i> - Italic text
<em> - Emphasized text
<mark> - Marked text
<small> - Smaller text
<del> - Deleted text
<ins> - Inserted text
<sub> - Subscript text
<sup> - Superscript text


HTML <blockquote> for Quotations
The HTML <blockquote> element defines a section that is quoted from another source.

Browsers usually indent <blockquote> elements.

<p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
<blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100 countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities, wildlife, and the places in which they live.
</blockquote>


HTML <q> for Short Quotations
The HTML <q> tag defines a short quotation.

Browsers normally insert quotation marks around the quotation.

<p>WWF's goal is to: <q>Build a future where people live in harmony with nature.</q></p>



HTML <abbr> for Abbreviations
The HTML <abbr> tag defines an abbreviation or an acronym, like "HTML", "CSS", "Mr.", "Dr.", "ASAP", "ATM".

Marking abbreviations can give useful information to browsers, translation systems and search-engines.

Tip: Use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element. 

<p>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

HTML <address> for Contact Information
The HTML <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.

The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.

The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

<address>
Written by John Doe.<br>
Visit us at:<br>
Example.com<br>
Box 564, Disneyland<br>
USA
</address>


HTML <cite> for Work Title
The HTML <cite> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book, a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).

Note: A person's name is not the title of a work.

The text in the <cite> element usually renders in italic.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>The HTML cite element defines the title of a work.</p>
<p>Browsers usually display cite elements in italic.</p>

<img src="img_the_scream.jpg" width="220" height="277" alt="The Scream">
<p><cite>The Scream</cite> by Edvard Munch. Painted in 1893.</p>

</body>
</html>


HTML <bdo> for Bi-Directional Override
BDO stands for Bi-Directional Override.

The HTML <bdo> tag is used to override the current text direction:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>If your browser supports bi-directional override (bdo), the next line will be written from right to left (rtl):</p>

<bdo dir="rtl">This line will be written from right to left</bdo>

</body>
</html>


****************
If your browser supports bi-directional override (bdo), the next line will be written from right to left (rtl):

This line will be written from right to left
******************

HTML Quotation and Citation Elements
Tag	Description
<abbr>	Defines an abbreviation or acronym
<address>	Defines contact information for the author/owner of a document
<bdo>	Defines the text direction
<blockquote>	Defines a section that is quoted from another source
<cite>	Defines the title of a work
<q>	Defines a short inline quotation

HTML Comment Tag
You can add comments to your HTML source by using the following syntax:

<!-- Write your comments here -->

************************************** COLOR NAMES *****************************
https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp

******************************************************

Background Color
You can set the background color for HTML elements:

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">Lorem ipsum...</p>


Text Color
You can set the color of text:

<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<p style="color:DodgerBlue;">Lorem ipsum...</p>
<p style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">Ut wisi enim...</p>


Border Color
You can set the color of borders:

<h1 style="border:2px solid Tomato;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid DodgerBlue;">Hello World</h1>
<h1 style="border:2px solid Violet;">Hello World</h1>


Color Values
In HTML, colors can also be specified using RGB values, HEX values, HSL values, RGBA values, and HSLA values.

The following three <div> elements have their background color set with RGB, HEX, and HSL values:

rgb(255, 99, 71)
#ff6347
hsl(9, 100%, 64%)
The following two <div> elements have their background color set with RGBA and HSLA values, which add an Alpha channel to the color (here we have 50% transparency):

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5)
hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5)

<h1 style="background-color:rgb(255, 99, 71);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#ff6347;">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsl(9, 100%, 64%);">...</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.5);">...</h1>
<h1 style="background-color:hsla(9, 100%, 64%, 0.5);">...</h1>


RGB Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified as an RGB value, using this formula:

rgb(red, green, blue)

******************************************************************
rgb scale https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors_rgb.asp **************************************************************************

**************************************************


Shades of Gray
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:

Example
rgb(60, 60, 60)
rgb(100, 100, 100)
rgb(140, 140, 140)
rgb(180, 180, 180)
rgb(200, 200, 200)
rgb(240, 240, 240)


RGBA Color Values
RGBA color values are an extension of RGB color values with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An RGBA color value is specified with:

rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

rgba(255, 99, 71, 0.1)



HEX Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified using a hexadecimal value in the form:

#rrggbb

Where rr (red), gg (green) and bb (blue) are hexadecimal values between 00 and ff (same as decimal 0-255).

For example, #ff0000 is displayed as red, because red is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (green and blue) are set to 00.

Another example, #00ff00 is displayed as green, because green is set to its highest value (ff), and the other two (red and blue) are set to 00.

To display black, set all color parameters to 00, like this: #000000.

To display white, set all color parameters to ff, like this: #ffffff.

Experiment by mixing the HEX values below:

#ff6347


Shades of Gray
Shades of gray are often defined using equal values for all three parameters:

Example
#404040
#686868
#a0a0a0
#bebebe
#dcdcdc
#f8f8f8


HSL Color Values
In HTML, a color can be specified using hue, saturation, and lightness (HSL) in the form:

hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)

Hue is a degree on the color wheel from 0 to 360. 0 is red, 120 is green, and 240 is blue.

Saturation is a percentage value. 0% means a shade of gray, and 100% is the full color.

Lightness is also a percentage value. 0% is black, and 100% is white.

Experiment by mixing the HSL values below:

hsl(0, 100%, 50%)


Shades of Gray
Shades of gray are often defined by setting the hue and saturation to 0, and adjusting the lightness from 0% to 100% to get darker/lighter shades:

Example
hsl(0, 0%, 20%)
hsl(0, 0%, 30%)
hsl(0, 0%, 40%)
hsl(0, 0%, 60%)
hsl(0, 0%, 70%)
hsl(0, 0%, 90%)


HSLA Color Values
HSLA color values are an extension of HSL color values, with an Alpha channel - which specifies the opacity for a color.

An HSLA color value is specified with:

hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)

The alpha parameter is a number between 0.0 (fully transparent) and 1.0 (not transparent at all):

Experiment by mixing the HSLA values below:

hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)


HTML Styles - CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.



What is CSS?
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, 
what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

Tip: The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent. 
So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all headings, paragraphs, 
and other text elements within the body will also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!


Using CSS
CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:

Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file
The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

Inline CSS
An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

An inline CSS uses the style attribute of an HTML element.

The following example sets the text color of the <h1> element to blue, and the text color of the <p> element to red:

Example
<h1 style="color:blue;">A Blue Heading</h1>

<p style="color:red;">A red paragraph.</p>


Internal CSS
An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page.

An internal CSS is defined in the <head> section of an HTML page, within a <style> element.

The following example sets the text color of ALL the <h1> elements (on that page) to blue, 
and the text color of ALL the <p> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color: 


Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


External CSS
An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <head> section of each HTML page:

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


The external style sheet can be written in any text editor. The file must not contain any HTML code, and must be saved with a .css extension.

Here is what the "styles.css" file looks like:

"styles.css":
body {
  background-color: powderblue;
}
h1 {
  color: blue;
}
p {
  color: red;
}


CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes
Here, we will demonstrate some commonly used CSS properties. You will learn more about them later.

The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

Example
Use of CSS color, font-family and font-size properties:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: verdana;
  font-size: 300%;
}
p {
  color: red;
  font-family: courier;
  font-size: 160%;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>


CSS Border
The CSS border property defines a border around an HTML element.

Tip: You can define a border for nearly all HTML elements.

Example
Use of CSS border property: 

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
}

CSS Padding
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border.

Example
Use of CSS border and padding properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  padding: 30px;
}


CSS Margin
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border.

Example
Use of CSS border and margin properties:

p {
  border: 2px solid powderblue;
  margin: 50px;
}


Link to External CSS
External style sheets can be referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

Example
This example uses a full URL to link to a style sheet:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/styles.css">


Chapter Summary
Use the HTML style attribute for inline styling
Use the HTML <style> element to define internal CSS
Use the HTML <link> element to refer to an external CSS file
Use the HTML <head> element to store <style> and <link> elements
Use the CSS color property for text colors
Use the CSS font-family property for text fonts
Use the CSS font-size property for text sizes
Use the CSS border property for borders
Use the CSS padding property for space inside the border
Use the CSS margin property for space outside the border


HTML Links - Hyperlinks
HTML links are hyperlinks.

You can click on a link and jump to another document.

When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.

Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

HTML Links - Syntax
The HTML <a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:

<a href="url">link text</a>
The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.

The link text is the part that will be visible to the reader.

Clicking on the link text, will send the reader to the specified URL address.

Example
This example shows how to create a link to W3Schools.com:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">Visit W3Schools.com!</a>


By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

An unvisited link is underlined and blue
A visited link is underlined and purple
An active link is underlined and red
Tip: Links can of course be styled with CSS, to get another look!

HTML Links - The target Attribute
By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.

The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.

The target attribute can have one of the following values:

_self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
_blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
_parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
_top - Opens the document in the full body of the window
Example
Use target="_blank" to open the linked document in a new browser window or tab:

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools!</a>


Absolute URLs vs. Relative URLs
Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute.

A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part):

Example
<h2>Absolute URLs</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a></p>

<h2>Relative URLs</h2>
<p><a href="html_images.asp">HTML Images</a></p>
<p><a href="/css/default.asp">CSS Tutorial</a></p>


HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:

Example
<a href="default.asp">
<img src="smiley.gif" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):

Example
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>



***************************************************

Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:

Example
<button onclick="document.location='default.asp'">HTML Tutorial</button>

***************************************************

Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.

Example
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" title="Go to W3Schools HTML section">Visit our HTML Tutorial</a>


More on Absolute URLs and Relative URLs
Example
Use a full URL to link to a web page: 

<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML tutorial</a>


Chapter Summary
Use the <a> element to define a link
Use the href attribute to define the link address
Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
Use the <img> element (inside <a>) to use an image as a link
Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program
